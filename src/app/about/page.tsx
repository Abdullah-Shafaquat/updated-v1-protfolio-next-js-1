        Hello! I’m Muhammad Abdullah, a Class 10 student with a strong enthusiasm for technology and design. Currently, I am enrolled in the GIAIC course, where I’m learning the fundamentals of web development and enhancing my skills in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Next.js. This portfolio is a collection of my projects that showcase my ability to merge creativity with technical knowledge, reflecting my journey as I strive to become a proficient developer. <br />
        <br />
        What excites me most is the opportunity to learn from others and share ideas. I enjoy participating in group projects and engaging in discussions that broaden my understanding of technology. I find that collaboration sparks creativity and leads to innovative solutions. Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I hope you find my work interesting, and I’m eager to receive any feedback that can help me grow in this dynamic field.
